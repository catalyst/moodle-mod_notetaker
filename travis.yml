  # Currently we are inside a clone of the repository.  We move up two
  # directories to build the project.

# Install this project into a directory called "ci".

  # The standard install step.
install:
    # Run the default install. The overview of what this does:
    #    - Clone the Moodle project into a directory called moodle.
    #    - Create a data directory called moodledata.
    #    - Create Moodle config.php, database, etc.
    #    - Copy your plugin(s) into Moodle.
    #    - Run Composer install within Moodle.
    #    - Run NPM install in Moodle and in your plugin if it has a "package.json".
    #    - Run "grunt ignorefiles" within Moodle to update ignore file lists.
    #    - If your plugin has Behat features, then Behat will be setup.
    #    - If your plugin has unit tests, then PHPUnit will be setup.
      - moodle-plugin-ci install

script:
  # This is basically "integration" testing.
  # This step lints your PHP files to check for syntax errors.
  - moodle-plugin-ci phplint
  # This step runs the PHP Copy/Paste Detector on your plugin.
  # This helps to find code duplication.
  - moodle-plugin-ci phpcpd
  # This step runs the PHP Mess Detector on your plugin. This helps to find
  # potential problems with your code which can result in
  # refactoring opportunities.
  - moodle-plugin-ci phpmd
  # This step runs the Moodle Code Checker to make sure that your plugin
  # conforms to the Moodle coding standards.
  # To fail on warnings use --max-warnings 0
  - moodle-plugin-ci codechecker
  # This step runs Moodle PHPDoc checker on your plugin.
  - moodle-plugin-ci phpdoc
  # This step runs some light validation on the plugin file structure
  # and code.  Validation can be plugin specific.
  - moodle-plugin-ci validate
  # This step validates your plugin's upgrade steps.
  - moodle-plugin-ci savepoints
  # This step validates the HTML and Javascript in your Mustache templates.
  - moodle-plugin-ci mustache
  # This step runs Grunt tasks on the plugin.  By default, it tries to run
  # tasks relevant to your plugin and Moodle version, but you can run
  # specific tasks by passing them as options,
  # EG: moodle-plugin-ci grunt -t task1 -t task2
  # To fail on eslint warnings use --max-lint-warnings 0
  - moodle-plugin-ci grunt || [ "$MOODLE_BRANCH" != 'master' -a "$MOODLE_BRANCH" != 'MOODLE_38_STABLE' ]
  # This step runs the PHPUnit tests of your plugin.  If your plugin has
  # PHPUnit tests, then it is highly recommended that you keep this step.
  # - moodle-plugin-ci phpunit --coverage-text
  # - moodle-plugin-ci behat --profile $PROFILE
